# Mr.Mackey 2.0 - Discord Chat Bot

This is the 2.0 interation of Mr.Mackey, which brings in Slash Command support and upgrades Discord.JS to 12.x.x

Thanks to MatteZ02 for the discord-interactions work - for this project's use case I just brought over the source code instead of installing the NPM repo. But we are using their fork of Discord.js for the custom listener: https://github.com/MatteZ02/discord.js
